Title: is it real or is it memex?

I love music. I was at music last night. cyrus chestnut at
dazzle jazz denver[link event]. after the show saw tom vernec (bass) and adam wolf (piano)
(spelling correct?) [link event] in the lounge[link]. late night for me, and i'm tired, but that's
also when my brain comes up with stuff.

after cyrus who was great and had a great drummer [find name and link] and bass
player [find name and link] ,
finished, i was chatting with the person next to me who was a retired
hs (music?) teacher. her husband had been a pro jazz drummer. she was really
digging the whole thing. our conversation got around to ai. she had
read klara and the sun recently and she can't get the robot as a human
friend out of her head. she wanted to know what i thought about ai.

i said that i'm not sure the singularity is near but that ai is able
to create lots of things. i pionted out though that i can't imagine
three computers playing together like thet trio on the stage. they had
amazing chemistry.

earlier in the day i got a text from Ed whom i grew up with with a a
link to a billy strings live stream [link] that was really great. he's
very talented. i was
getting ready to go to the concert. i commented how amazing tech was
and that when we were growing up i had no idea we'd have what we have
now.

i sent him a link to a the bt alc big band radio playlist on spotify
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E4FpBmUcbuPW1?si=491fbf14c8d64a40
that i had been listening too earlier in the day. i was amazed at home
many new releases were on the list and i was save lots of new (to me)
artists. he listened to the radio the next day and said he loved the
funk and that he wished he could play with a band like that. me too.

one of my regrets that i didn't keep up with music like he did. we
used to play together as kids. the late night duo were two guys who
knew each other for over 40 years, just like me and ed. i fantasized
about ed and i playing like that. they had a great grove going.

today i started go through the new artists of the songs i favorited
yesterday. one of them "take your time" was interesting. a bit too
electronic for me but they had a great groove. i tried to read more
about them. there was nothing about the artist on spotify but they had
a lot of albums so i googled them and come up with this reddit
thread
https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1is7jhk/take_your_time_on_spotify_ai_generated_music/
which said it is ai generated music. one of the people wrote:

> "i prompt the style of music that i want, then i choose the best parts

> production software, it takes approx several hours for every playlist,
> after i enhance production and sound it's all ready go"

wow, i thought they were a real band. very complex music. here's a
song called "straight to the point"
https://open.spotify.com/track/4cjO5jJRVqdy4oVitlItfy?si=f2d79660da454061
which is on their latest release (may) and had 6k listens. the creator
has 105k listeners.

i'm sure my more music literate friends will say this is ai drivel. i
find it compelling. not as compelling as, say the shootin' the shit
https://open.spotify.com/track/2iu2M71L6IbfsLLHGkbCHS?si=e70720ed6eb241ce
by the bt alc big band but still "straight to the point" was one of
handful of new songs that i favorited not knowing it was ai
generated.

i have been listening to sampled music for decades. someone like adam
dorn (aka mocean worker) creates great stuff imho. much music nowadays
is sampled. milli vanilli maybe is the first example of a lip sync
scandal but the monkees weren't allowed to play their own music.


when i was growing up there was an ad for is it live or is it memorex
[link]. vanneveer bush(sp?) talked about memex in his prescient
article [link] about what we can expect of technology. we are living
in that time, just a bit faster and more suddenly than anybody
expected, i think.

i think a quote from robert lucky's bozos on the bus is
appropriate. would be good here.
