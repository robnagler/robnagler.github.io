I am a father, friend, and programmer. I do not share personal
information about my children or my friends online. Therefore, this
site mostly contains my opinions about programming, society, books,
and other impersonal subjects.. This belies the fact that I identify
much more as a father and friend than programmer.

Over the years, I've written a lot about
[Programming](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+programming).
This site collects some of these works, and is the repository for new
articles.

My opinions about programming and other subjects change over time.
For example, my book
[Extreme Perl](http://www.extremeperl.org) was my early thinking on
how to devolve responsibility in a team.
The methodology parts are too structured, and are not consistent with
how I evolve software now, which is much more ad hoc.

[Evolution](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+evolution)
factors big in my current thinking about software.  This
wasn't always the case.  I was a big fan of the waterfall model in the
1980s until I saw people and relationships as the core issue.
Programming-in-the-large requires a
[team of trust](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+team+trust).

Code evolves by integrating
[feedback](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+feedback).
The more feedback, the better.
A team of trust is fearless and can accept any feedback thrown at it.
Team members are never fearless.  Only in a team do we create a bond
of trust that enables us to overcome our particular fears in any one
instance.

[Psychology](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+psychology)
figures centrally in my life and work.
I strive to understand how my psyche affects my
actions and reactions. I used to visit a psychologist regularly to help me
integrate the feedback the real world threw at me. I'm better able to
do this on my own now, but I also rely on my
incredibly supportive family, friends, and work colleagues.

In the last few years, I have been meditating daily. I highly
recommend
[Jeff Warren's guided meditations](https://jeffwarren.org/explore/meditations/).

In addition to conversations, my opinions are informed by my reading.
You can find many
[notes on books I find interesting](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+BookNotes)
on this site. I continue to backfill on this site years of notes I've
taken about books.

I have had rapture of the bits since I was nine.  I have always worked
in software, and continue to do so.
[Check my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robnagler) where I'm
working now.

This page will evolve over time.  It'll reflect my current thinking on
a variety of subjects, and serve as a jumping off point of what I
think is relevant. Alternatively, you can sign up [for the RSS feed](feed.xml)
for recent updates.
