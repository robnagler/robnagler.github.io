By Helen Pluckrose & James A. Lindsay, Pitchstone, May 5, 2020, 1634312023

This is an intense book. Pluckrose and Lindsay argue ferociously for
the case against Critical Social Justice, which is distinct from the
everyday social justice of liberal society. They are secular liberals
who contend that Postmodern Theory is illiberal, and inhibits
progress towards racial, gender, sexual, etc. equality.

The authors take a deep dive into Theory and its roots in postmodernism,
which I found very interesting and enjoyable. They include lots of
examples of Theorists both in the past and today. Their case is
strong, because the clearly understand what Theory is.

This book is a good antidote to
[White Fragility]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-07-05-White-Fragility %}).
I am now even more convinced that the DiAngelo's approach is
unhelpful.

> [k98] This movement nominally pursues and derives its name from a broad
> goal called "social justice," which is a term dating back almost two
> hundred years.

> [k101] Perhaps most famously, the liberal progressive philosopher John
> Rawls laid out much philosophical theory dedicated to the conditions

> In this, he set out a universalist thought experiment in which a

> group.
> Another, explicitly anti-liberal, anti-universal, approach to
> achieving social justice has also been employed, particularly since the
> middle of the twentieth century, and that is one rooted in __critical
> theory__.

> [k108] Postmodernism, in some sense, was an offshoot of this critical
> approach that went its own theoretical way for a while and was then taken
> up again by critical social justice activists through the 1980s and 1990s
> (who, incidentally, very rarely reference John Rawls on the topic).

> [k113] Social Justice, as a proper noun with capital S and capital J,
> refers to a very specific doctrinal interpretation of the meaning of
> "social justice" and means of achieving it while prescribing a strict,
> identifiable orthodoxy around that term.

> [k118] Let us make clear our own social and political commitments: we
> find ourselves against capitalized Social Justice because we are
> generally for lowercase social justice.

> [k153] That is what we set out to provide in this book: a guide to the
> language and customs that are presently widely promoted under the
> pleasant-sounding moniker "Social Justice."

> [k159] Postmodern ideas have shaped what has since mostly been called
> __Theory__--the entity which is, in some sense, the protagonist of this book.

> [k162] Of note, throughout this book, __Theory__ (and related words, such as
> Theorist and Theoretical) with a capital T will refer to the approach to
> social philosophy that stems from postmodernism.
>
> __Cynical Theories__ explains how Theory has developed into the
> driving force of the culture war of the late 2010s--and proposes a
> philosophically __liberal__ way to counter its manifestations in scholarship,
> activism, and everyday life.

> [k186] We can see its impact on the world in their attacks on science and
> reason. It is also evident in their assertions that society is
> simplistically divided into dominant and marginalized identities and
> underpinned by invisible systems of white supremacy, patriarchy,
> heteronormativity, cisnormativity, ableism, and fatphobia. We find
> ourselves faced with the continuing dismantlement of categories like
> knowledge and belief, reason and emotion, and men and women, and with
> increasing pressures to censor our language in accordance with The Truth
> According to Social Justice.

> [k230] A fundamental change in human thought took place in the 1960s.
> This change is associated with several French Theorists who, while not
> quite household names, float at the edges of the popular imagination,
> among them Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-Francois
> Lyotard.

> [k239] It is probably most useful to understand postmodernism as a
> rejection of both modern__ism__--an intellectual movement that predominated
> through the late nineteenth century and the first half of the
> twentieth--and modern__ity__--that epoch known as the Modern period, which
> began after the end of the Middle Ages and in which we (probably) still
> live.

> [k248] Postmodernism raised such radical doubts about the structure of
> thought and society that it is ultimately a form of cynicism.

> [k269] Italian postmodernists tended to foreground its aesthetic elements
> and viewed it as a continuation of modernism, while American
> postmodernists leaned toward more straightforward and pragmatic
> approaches.
> The French postmodernists were altogether more focused on the
> social and on revolutionary and __deconstructive__ approaches to modernism.
> It is the French approach that will be of most interest to us,
> because it is primarily some of the French ideas, especially about
> knowledge and power, which have evolved over the course of successive
> variants of postmodernism's central occupation, that which is often
> simply called __Theory__.

> [k282] These include skepticism about objective reality, the perception
> of language as the constructor of knowledge, the "making" of the
> individual, and the role played by power in all of these. These factors
> underlie the "postmodern turn," which is primarily a product of the 1960s
> and 1970s.

> [k304] This, in turn, sparked fears that society was degenerating into an
> artificial, hedonistic, capitalist, consumerist world of fantasy and
> play.
>
> This reaction often took the form of the pervasive pessimism that
> characterizes postmodern thinking, fueling fears about human hubris on
> one hand and the loss of meaning and authenticity on the other. This
> despair was so pronounced that postmodernism itself could be
> characterized as a profound cultural crisis of confidence and
> authenticity alongside a growing distrust of liberal social orders.

> [k319] At the end of the sixteenth century, treatises against atheism
> also began to appear, which clearly suggests that disbelief in God had
> begun to circulate.

> [k321] The Scientific Revolution was the result of widespread
> questioning of received wisdom and the rapid proliferation of different
> kinds of knowledge production. The development of the scientific method
> in the nineteenth century was centered on skepticism and the need for
> increasingly rigorous testing and falsification.

> [k325] These concerns were especially acutely expressed by Jean
> Baudrillard. For Baudrillard, whose nihilistic despair at the loss of the
> "real" drew heavily on the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,
> all realities had become mere simulations (imitations of real-world
> phenomena and systems) and simulacra ("copies" of things without an
> original). Baudrillard described three levels of simulacra: associated
> with the premodern, modern, and postmodern.

> [k330] In the modern period, this link broke down because items began to
> be mass-produced and each original could therefore have many identical
> copies. In the postmodern period, he concluded, there is no original and
> all is simulacra, which are unsatisfactory imitations and images of the
> real. This state Baudrillard referred to as the __hyperreal__. This evinces
> the postmodernists' tendency to seek the roots of meaning in language and
> to become overly concerned with the ways in which it shapes social
> reality through its ability to constrain and shape knowledge--that which
> represents what is true.

> [k339] In a typical expression of the despair at the heart of
> postmodernism, he diagnosed a __waning of affect__--the idea that there is no
> longer any heart to anything. For Jameson, surface aesthetics preoccupy
> our attention and distance and distract people from caring too deeply.

> [k352] Ultimately, these thinkers are referring to a general feeling that
> the scientific and ethical certainties that characterized much thought
> about modernity had become untenable, and the loss of their preferred
> analytic tools rendered the situation completely hopeless. Their summary
> of this state took the form of an extremely radical skepticism and
> profound cynicism, particularly about language, knowledge, power, and the
> individual.

> [k379] The perception of society as formed of individuals interacting
> with universal reality in unique ways--which underlies the liberal
> principles of individual freedom, shared humanity, and equal
> opportunities--was replaced by multiple allegedly equally valid
> knowledges and truths, constructed by groups of people with shared
> markers of identity related to their positions in society.

> [k405] * __The postmodern knowledge principle__: Radical skepticism about whether objective knowledge or truth is obtainable and a commitment to cultural constructivism.
> * __The postmodern political principle__: A belief that society is formed of systems of power and hierarchies, which decide what can be known and how.
>
> [k408] The four major themes of postmodernism are
> 1. The blurring of boundaries
> 2.The power of language
> 3. Cultural relativism
> 4. The loss of the individual and the universal

> [k424] The scientific method, in particular, is not seen as a better way
> of producing and legitimizing knowledge than any other, but as one
> cultural approach among many, as corrupted by biased reasoning as any
> other.

> [k428] Instead, it is the position that humans are so tied into their
> cultural frameworks that all truth or knowledge claims are merely
> representations of those frameworks--we have decided that "it is true" or
> "it is known" that the Earth goes round the Sun __because of the way we
> establish truth in our current culture__.
n
> [k441] In this sense, postmodernism rests upon a broad rejection of the
> __correspondence theory of truth__: that is, the position that there are
> objective truths and that they can be established as true by their
> correspondence with how things actually are in the world.

> [k453] Dominant discourses are extremely powerful because they determine
> what can be considered true, thus applicable, in a given time and place.
> Thus, sociopolitical power is the ultimate determiner of what is true in
> Foucault's analysis, not correspondence with reality.

> [k461] Foucault didn't deny that a reality exists, but he doubted the
> ability of humans to transcend our cultural biases enough to get at it.

> [k466] The principle of skepticism common among postmodernists is
> frequently referred to as "__radical__ skepticism." It says, "All knowledge
> is constructed: what is interesting is theorizing about why knowledge got
> constructed this way."

> [k471] In postmodern thinking, that which is known is only known within
> the cultural paradigm that produced the knowledge and is therefore
> representative of its systems of power.

> [k475] Ultimately, Lyotard feared that science and technology were just
> one "language game"--one way of legitimating truth claims--and that they
> were taking over all other language games. He mourned the demise of small
> local "knowledges" passed on in narrative form and viewed the loss of
> meaning-making intrinsic to scientific detachment as a loss of valuable
> narratives.

> [k481] It did, however, fail to appreciate that scientific and other
> forms of liberal reasoning (such as arguments in favor of democracy and
> capitalism) are not so much metanarratives (though they can adopt these)
> as imperfect but self-correcting processes that apply a productive and
> actionable form of skepticism to everything, including themselves.

> [k487] Postmodernism is characterized politically by its intense focus on
> power as the guiding and structuring force of society, a focus which is
> codependent on the denial of objective knowledge
> Power and knowledge are seen as inextricably entwined--most
> explicitly in Foucault's work, which refers to knowledge as
> "power-knowledge."

> [k496] Because of their focus on power dynamics, these thinkers argued
> that the powerful have, both intentionally and inadvertently, organized
> society to benefit them and perpetuate their power. They have done so by
> legitimating certain ways of talking about things as true, which then
> spread throughout society, creating societal rules that are viewed as
> common sense and perpetuated on all levels.

> [k507] Thus, a society, social system, or institution can be seen as in
> some way oppressive without any individual involved with it needing to be
> shown to hold even a single oppressive view.


> [k510] Instead, they regard it as the inevitable result of
> self-perpetuating systems that privilege some groups over others, which
> constitute an __un__conscious, __un__coordinated conspiracy inherent to systems
> involving power. They believe, however, that those systems are
> patriarchal, white supremacist, and heteronormative, and therefore
> necessarily grant unfair access to straight, white Western men and work
> to maintain that status quo by excluding the perspectives of women and of
> racial and sexual minorities.

> [k521] Because they focused on self-perpetuating systems of power, few of
> the original postmodern Theorists advocated any specific political
> actions, preferring instead to engage in playful disruption or nihilistic
> despair.

> [k538] Progress occurred fastest of all in the 1960s and 1970s, when
> racial and gender discrimination became illegal and homosexuality was
> decriminalized.
> This all occurred __before__ postmodernism became influential.

> [k543] Because of its rejection of objective truth and reason,
> postmodernism refuses to substantiate itself and cannot, therefore, be
> argued with.
> The postmodern perception, Lyotard writes, makes no claim to be
> true: "Our hypotheses, therefore, should not be accorded predictive value
> in relation to reality, but strategic value in relation to the question
> raised."

> [k551] __1. The Blurring of Boundaries__

> [k556] Almost every socially significant category has been intentionally
> complicated and problematized by postmodern Theorists in order to deny
> such categories any objective validity and disrupt the systems of power
> that might exist across them.
>
>  [k558] __2. The Power of Language__

> [k561] In postmodern thought, language is believed to have enormous power
> to control society and how we think and thus is inherently dangerous.

> [k564] Few thinkers exhibit the neurotic postmodern fixation upon words
> more explicitly than Jacques Derrida, who, in 1967, published three
> texts--__Of Grammatology__, __Writing and Difference__, and __Speech and
> Phenomena__--in which he introduced a concept that would become very
> influential in postmodernism: __deconstruction__.

> [k571] This unreliability of language, Derrida argues, means that it
> cannot represent reality or communicate it to others. In this
> understanding, language operates hierarchically through binaries, always
> placing one element above another to make meaning.

> [k578] Consequently, since discourses are believed to create and maintain
> oppression, they have to be carefully monitored and deconstructed.


> [k580] The most common postmodernist response to this derives from
> Derrida's proposed solution: to read "deconstructively," by looking for
> internal inconsistencies (__aporia__) in which a text contradicts and
> undermines itself and its own purposes when the words are examined
> closely enough (which is to say, too closely and, especially since the
> 1990s, with an agenda--Theory's normative agenda).

> [k584] __3. Cultural Relativism__

> [k587] For postmodernists, any meaningful critique of a culture's values
> and ethics from within a different culture is impossible, since each
> culture operates under different concepts of knowledge and speaks only
> from its own biases.

> [k597] __4. The Loss of the Individual and the Universal__
>
> Consequently, to postmodern Theorists, the notion of the
> autonomous individual is largely a myth. The individual, like everything
> else, is a product of powerful discourses and culturally constructed
> knowledge.

> [k602] The postmodern view largely rejects both the smallest unit of
> society--the individual--and the largest--humanity--and instead focuses
> on small, local groups as the producers of knowledge, values, and
> discourses.

> [k606] The prevailing view among many thinkers today is that
> postmodernism has died out. We don't think it has.
>

> [k608] Theory is intact, although the ways in which its core principles
> and themes are presented, used, and interacted with have changed
> significantly over the last half-century.

> [k616] In that sense, postmodern Theory's __high deconstructive phase__ burnt
> itself out by the mid-1980s.

> [k618] For this reason, we call the next wave of activism-scholarship
> __applied postmodernism__, and it is to this development we now turn our
> attention.

> [k627] The postmodernists sought to render absurd our ways of
> understanding, approaching, and living in the world and in societies.


> [k629] Endless dismantling and disruption--or, as they call it,
> __deconstruction__--is not only destined to consume itself; it is also fated
> to consume everything interesting and thus render itself __boring__.

> [k633] After its first big bang beginning in the late 1960s, the high
> deconstructive phase of postmodernism burnt itself out by the early
> 1980s.

> [k636] But, in fact, it simply mutated from its earlier high
> deconstructive phase into a new form. A diverse set of highly politicized
> and actionable Theories developed out of postmodernism proper. We will
> call this more recent development __applied postmodernism__.

> [k640] During this turn, Theory mutated into a handful of
> Theories--postcolonial, queer, and critical race--that were put to work
> in the world to deconstruct social injustice.

> [k646] These are centered on a practical aim that was absent before: to
> reconstruct society in the image of an ideology which came to refer to
> itself as "Social Justice."

> [k651] Theory therefore explicitly aims to __critically__ examine discourses.
> This means something specific. It means to examine them closely so as to
> expose and disrupt the political power dynamics it assumes are baked into
> them so that people will be convinced to reject them and initiate an
> ideological revolution.


> [k654] Between the late 1980s and roughly 2010, it developed the
> applicability of its underlying concepts and came to form the basis of
> entirely new fields of scholarship, which have since become profoundly
> influential. These new disciplines, which have come to be known loosely
> as "Social Justice scholarship," co-opted the notion of social justice
> from the civil rights movements and other liberal and progressive
> theories.

> [k662] The new forms of Theory arose within postcolonialism, black
> feminism (a branch of feminism pioneered by African American scholars who
> focused as much on race as on gender3), intersectional feminism, critical
> race (legal) Theory, and queer Theory, all of which sought to describe
> the world critically __in order to change it__.

> [k668] Some of the new Theorists therefore criticized their predecessors
> for their privilege, which they claimed was demonstrated by their ability
> to deconstruct identity and identity-based oppression.

> [k671] As a result, while the new Theorists retained much Theory, they did not entirely dispense with stable identity and objective truth.
> Instead, they laid claim to a limited amount of both, arguing that
> some identities were privileged over others and that this injustice was
> objectively true.

> [k678] During its applied turn, Theory underwent a __moral__ mutation: it
> adopted a number of beliefs about the rights and wrongs of power and
> privilege. The original Theorists were content to observe, bemoan, and
> play with such phenomena; the new ones wanted to reorder society.

> [k715] Whether we call it "postmodernism," "applied postmodernism,"
> "Theory," or anything else, then, the conception of society based on the
> postmodern knowledge and political principles--that set of radically
> skeptical ideas, in which knowledge, power, and language are merely
> oppressive social constructs to be exploited by the powerful--has not
> only survived more or less intact but also flourished within many
> identity-and culture-based "studies" fields, especially in the so-called
> "Theoretical humanities." These, in turn, influence and often hold sway
> over the social sciences and professional programs like education, law,
> psychology, and social work, and have been carried by activists and media
> into the broader culture.

> [k733] The correction to this problem required grasping upon something
> both radically actionable and real, and Theory and activism therefore
> started to coalesce on a new idea in parallel to Descartes' most famous
> meditation. For him, the ability to think implied existence--that
> __something__ must be real. For the activist-scholars of the 1980s, the
> suffering associated with oppression implied the existence of something
> that could suffer and a mechanism by which that suffering can occur.

> [k741] Among them, queer Theory is the only field that exclusively
> applies postmodern Theoretical approaches, but all these fields of study
> have come to be dominated by applied postmodernist thinking.
> The Theorists who took elements of postmodernism and sought to
> apply them in specific ways were the progenitors of the applied
> postmodern turn and therefore of Social Justice scholarship.
>
> Postcolonial studies was the first applied postmodern discipline
> to emerge.

> [k745] Edward Said, the founding father of postcolonial Theory, drew
> heavily on Michel Foucault, and his work therefore focused on how
> discourses construct reality.


> [k748] In his ground-breaking book, __Orientalism__, he argues that
> "history is made by men and women, just as it can also be unmade and
> rewritten...so that 'our' East, 'our' Orient becomes 'ours' to possess
> and direct."

> [k774] In her most influential work, __Gender Trouble__, published in 1990,
> Butler focuses on the socially constructed nature of both gender __and__ sex.
> For Butler, "woman" is not a class of people but a performance that
> constructs "gendered" reality.

> [k786] However, this is not a disparagement of postmodernism, since
> incoherence and indefinability are central to Butler's queer Theory. In
> her 1995 essay, "Contingent Foundations: Feminism and the Question of
> 'Postmodernism,'" Butler writes, in her usual semi-incomprehensible
> prose, that the point of postmodernism is to understand that oppressive
> power structures form as a result of firm definitions and stable
> categories and that recognizing this enables queer political activism.
> Therefore, rather than denying postmodern assumptions or
> methods, Butler argues that--just as it is better not to define sexes,
> genders, or sexualities--it is better not to define postmodernism.

> [k810] For hooks, the problem was not that postmodernism was useless; it
> was that it was tailored to the experiences of white male intellectuals
> and did not allow for identity politics.
> hooks claimed that postmodern thought erred in destabilizing the
> concept of identity, which led it to exclude the unified voices and
> experiences of black Americans--particularly black women--and their
> aspirations to disrupt dominant narratives for the purposes of pursuing
> racial equality.

> [k821] hooks' ideas arose in parallel with critical race Theory, which
> originated with critical legal scholars, most notably Derrick Bell.
> One of Bell's students was a legal scholar much influenced by
> black feminists like hooks: Kimberle Crenshaw. Crenshaw makes a
> similar critique of postmodernism in her groundbreaking 1991 essay,
> "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence
> Against Women of Color," which developed the groundwork for the hugely
> influential concept of __intersectionality__, which she had introduced two
> years earlier, in a more polemic piece (see chapter 5).

> [k852] Following Crenshaw's recommendation, these rapidly emerging fields
> of critical studies of culture all rely heavily on social constructivism
> to explain why some identities are marginalized, while arguing that those
> social constructions are themselves objectively real.

> [k858] They have become part of the intersectional framework and adopted
> much of the applied postmodern Theoretical approach, in which the
> disabled and the fat are believed to have their own embodied knowledge of
> disability and fatness, which is worth more than scientific knowledge.
> This is not simply about the obvious truth that disabled and fat people
> know what it is like to be disabled or fat in a way that able-bodied and
> slim people do not. Scholars and activists in these fields insist instead
> that the understanding of disability or obesity as a physical problem to
> be treated and corrected where possible is itself a social construct born
> of systemic hatred of disabled and fat people.

> [k879] Their common concern with what they call "disrupting binaries"
> follows from Derrida's work on the hierarchical nature and
> meaninglessness of linguistic constructions. This theme is less evident
> in critical race Theory, which can be quite black-and-white (double
> meaning intended), but, in practice, the intersectional feminist element
> of critical race Theory encompasses many identity categories
> simultaneously and tries to be inclusive of "different ways of knowing."

> [k888] Additionally, the idea that words are powerful and dangerous has
> now become widespread and underlies much scholarship and activism around
> discursive (or verbal) violence, safe spaces, microaggressions, and
> trigger warnings.

> [k896] The intense focus on identity categories and identity politics
> means that the individual and the universal are largely devalued.

> [k904] By losing the ironic playfulness and despair of meaning
> characteristic of high-deconstructive postmodernism and by becoming
> goal-oriented, Theorists of the 1980s and 1990s made postmodernism
> applicable to institutions and politics.

> [k907] Theory therefore turned from being largely descriptive to highly
> prescriptive--a shift from __is__ to __ought__.


> [k909] This ambition would come to fruition in the early 2010s, when a
> second significant evolutionary mutation in postmodernism occurred.

> [k911] If knowledge is a construct of power, which functions through ways
> of talking about things, knowledge can be changed and power structures
> toppled by changing the way we talk about things.

> [k919] This belief increased the aggressiveness of identity politics to
> such an extent that it even led to concepts like "research justice." This
> alarming proposal demands that scholars preferentially cite women and
> minorities--and minimize citations of white Western men--because
> empirical research that values knowledge production rooted in evidence
> and reasoned argument is an unfairly privileged cultural construct of
> white Westerners.

> [k924] As these methods can be applied to virtually anything, a vast body
> of work drawing on any (or all) identity-based fields has emerged since
> roughly 2010.
> It asserts the objective truth of socially constructed knowledge
> and power hierarchies with absolute certainty.

> [k936] Such people can both be disadvantaged as knowers, when they are
> forced to operate within a "dominant" system that is not their own, and
> also enjoy unique advantages, because of their familiarity with multiple
> epistemic systems. They can alternately be victims of "epistemic
> violence" when their knowledge is not included or recognized or of
> "epistemic exploitation" when they are asked to share it.

> [k942] Teachers could consider their attempts at objectivity successful
> if their students did not know what their political or ideological
> positions were.


> [k944] Teaching is now supposed to be a political act, and only one
> type of politics is acceptable--identity politics, as defined by Social
> Justice and Theory.

> [k947] Now, scholars can openly declare themselves to be activists and
> teach activism in courses that require students to accept the ideological
> basis of Social Justice as true and produce work that supports it.

> [k963] Activism and education exist in a fundamental tension--activism
> presumes to know the truth with enough certainty to act upon it, while
> education is conscious that it does not know for certain what is true and
> therefore seeks to learn more.

> [k978] What has happened is that applied postmodernism has come into its
> own, been __reified__--taken as real, as The Truth according to Social
> Justice--and widely spread by activists, and (ironically) turned into a
> dominant metanarrative of its own.

> [k1014] Then, with surprising rapidity, European colonialism faltered and
> collapsed in the middle of the twentieth century. Following World War II
> especially, decolonization efforts proceeded quickly on both the material
> and political levels, and, by the early 1960s, moral concerns about
> colonialism were prominent in both the academy and among the general
> public, especially on the radical left.

> [k1029] Then, his 1961 book, __The Wretched of the Earth__, set the stage
> for postcolonialism and postcolonial Theory. Its thesis marked a profound
> change in thought on the subject. To Fanon, by 1961, colonialism
> represented, above all else, a systematic denial of the humanity of
> colonized people: so central is this theme to Fanon's analysis that he
> speaks throughout of the literal erasure of people's identity and
> dignity.

> [k1034] Writing in 1961, however, Fanon was hardly a postmodernist. His

> essentially humanist. Nevertheless, later thinkers, including Edward
> Said, the father of postcolonial Theory, took inspiration from Fanon's
> depiction of the psychological impacts of having one's culture, language,
> and religion subordinated to another.

> [k1049] Said presented his new ideas in the book __Orientalism__, published
> in 1978.6 This book not only laid a foundation for the development of
> postcolonial Theory, but also brought the concept of applicable
> postmodern Theory to an American audience.

> [k1060] Said argues that at the core of Orientalism lies a Western
> discourse, and it was this discourse that constructed the East, by
