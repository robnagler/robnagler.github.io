By Matthew Walker, Scribner, October 3, 2017, 978-1501144325

It's thorough and well-written. Walker explains the process of sleep
in great detail. Then he tells us how we need to change society,
particularly school hours. It's a little bit over the top in the
second to last chapter where sleep is the cause of everything.

He presents lots of confirming studies. I am a little skeptical that
he doesn't present some alternative studies that disagree with his
bias towards sleep. I found an insignificant factual error (repeating
urban legend about coffee trade -- see below), which was easily
invalidated, but it demonstrates his over the top belief in the
studies he presents.

If you don't know much about sleep, this is very readable book.

NOTE: [Not true](http://n99.us/yqf): In 2017, oil was $788B, aluminum
was $106B, copper was $104B, iron ore was $67B, and coffee was $19B.

> [k713] Since your brain desires most of its REM sleep in the last
> part of the night, which is to say the late-morning hours, you will
> lose 60 to 90 percent of all your REM sleep, even though you are
> losing 25 percent of your total sleep time.

> [k825] When it comes to information processing, think of the wake
> state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning
> the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and
> strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and
> REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with
> each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an
> ever more accurate model of how the world works, including
> innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

NOTE: Do they have night owls and early birds?

> [k1090] The practice of biphasic sleep is not cultural in origin,
> however. It is deeply biological. All humans, irrespective of
> culture or geographical location, have a genetically hardwired dip
> in alertness that occurs in the midafternoon hours.

> [k1127] These napping communities have sometimes been described as
> "the places where people forget to die." From a prescription written
> long ago in our ancestral genetic code, the practice of natural
> biphasic sleep, and a healthy diet, appear to be the keys to a
> long-sustained life. WE ARE SPECIAL Sleep, as you can now
> appreciate, is a unifying feature across the animal kingdom, yet
> within and between species there is remarkable diversity in amount
> (e.g., time), form (e.g., half-brain, whole-brain), and pattern
> (monophasic, biphasic, polyphasic).

> [k1171] From these clues, I offer a theorem: the tree-to-ground
> reengineering of sleep was a key trigger that rocketed Homo sapiens
> to the top of evolution's lofty pyramid. At least two features
> define human beings relative to other primates. I posit that both
> have been beneficially and causally shaped by the hand of sleep, and
> specifically our intense degree of REM sleep relative to all other
> mammals: (1) our degree of sociocultural complexity, and (2) our
> cognitive intelligence. REM sleep, and the act of dreaming itself,
> lubricates both of these human traits.

> [k1292] Most notable, however, is the significant shortage of REM
> sleep. Autistic individuals show a 30 to 50 percent deficit in the
> amount of REM sleep they obtain, relative to children without
> autism.

> [k1304] Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep
> that we know of.

> [k1417] As deep NREM sleep performs its final overhaul and
> refinement of the brain during adolescence, cognitive skills,
> reasoning, and critical thinking start to improve, and do so in a
> proportional manner with that NREM sleep change. Taking a closer
> look at the timing of this relationship, you see something even more
> interesting. The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the
> cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several
> weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may
> be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way
> around. Feinberg made a second seminal discovery. When he examined
> the timeline of changing deep-sleep intensity at each different
> electrode spot on the head, it was not the same. Instead, the
> rise-and-fall pattern of maturation always began at the back of the
> brain, which performs the functions of visual and spatial
> perception, and then progressed steadily forward as adolescence
> progressed.

> [k1427] His findings helped explain why rationality is one of the
> last things to flourish in teenagers, as it is the last brain
> territory to receive sleep's maturational treatment.

> [k1452] Faulty pruning of brain connections in schizophrenia caused
> by sleep abnormalities is now one of the most active and exciting
> areas of investigation in psychiatric illness.

> [k1679] Sleep before learning refreshes our ability to initially
> make new memories .

> [k1698] In contrast, those who napped did markedly better, and
> actually improved in their capacity to memorize facts. The
> difference between the two groups at six p.m. was not small: a 20
> percent learning advantage for those who slept.

> [k2161] The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen
> hours. After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to
> fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to
> maintain cognitive performance.

> [k2168] As a result, 1.2 million accidents are caused by sleepiness
> each year in the United States.

> [k2176] As a result, car crashes caused by drowsiness tend to be far
> more deadly than those caused by alcohol or drugs.

> [k2181] And when a truck driver loses his or her life in a
> drowsy-driving crash, they will, on average, take 4.5 other lives

> [k2509] Should you experimentally prevent a mouse from getting NREM
> sleep, keeping it awake instead, there is an immediate increase in
> amyloid deposits within the brain. Without sleep, an escalation of
> poisonous Alzheimer's-related protein accumulated in the brains of
> the mice, together with several other toxic metabolites.

> [k2516] From this cascade comes a prediction: getting too little
> sleep across the adult life span will significantly raise your risk
> of developing Alzheimer's disease. Precisely this relationship has
> now been reported in numerous epidemiological studies, including
> those individuals suffering from sleep disorders such as insomnia
> and sleep apnea.

> [k3016] But we had to wait until the advent of brain-imaging
> machines in the early 2000s before we could reconstruct glorious,
> three-dimensional visualizations of brain activity during REM
> sleep. It was worth the wait. Among other breakthroughs, the method
> and the results undermined the postulates of Sigmund Freud and his
> nonscientific theory of dreams as wish fulfillment, which had
> dominated psychiatry and psychology for an entire century. There
> were important virtues of Freud's theory, and we will discuss them
> below. But there were deep and systemic flaws that led to a
> rejection of the theory by modern-day science.

> [k3160] Nevertheless, the psychoanalytic method built on Freudian

> order for us to heal emotional wounds.

> [k3285] Cartwright had shown that it was not enough to have REM
> sleep, or even generic dreaming, when it comes to resolving our
> emotional past. Her patients required REM sleep with dreaming, but
> dreaming of a very specific kind: that which expressly involved
> dreaming about the emotional themes and sentiments of the waking
> trauma.

> [k3301] The theory proposed that a contributing mechanism underlying
> the PTSD is the excessively high levels of noradrenaline within the
> brain that blocks the ability of these patients from entering and
> maintaining normal REM-sleep dreaming.

> [k3321] It turns out that the drug prazosin, which Raskind was
> prescribing simply to lower blood pressure, also has the fortuitous
> side effect of suppressing noradrenaline in the brain. Raskind had

> condition--a lowering of the abnormally high concentrations of
> stress-related noradrenaline--within the brain during REM sleep that
> had been absent for so long in these PTSD patients.

> [k3732] While the reasons remain unclear, insomnia is almost twice
> as common in women than in men, and it is unlikely that a simple
> unwillingness of men to admit sleep problems explains this very
> sizable difference between the two sexes. Race and ethnicity also
> make a significant difference, with African Americans and Hispanic
> Americans suffering higher rates of insomnia than Caucasian
> Americans--findings that have important implications for
> well-recognized health disparities in these communities, such as
> diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, which have known

> widespread and serious problem than even these sizable numbers
> suggest.

> [k3754] The two most common triggers of chronic insomnia are
> psychological: (1) emotional concerns, or worry, and (2) emotional
> distress,

> [k3781] Simply put, the insomnia patients could not disengage from a
> pattern of altering, worrisome, ruminative brain activity.

> [k4252] Many people enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, even an
> aperitif thereafter. But it takes your liver and kidneys many hours

> will disrupt your sleep, and the annoying advice of abstinence is
> the best, and most honest, I can offer.

> [k4329] Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more
> deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.

> [k4686] Interestingly, participants in the above studies do not
