By Gerald Weinberg, Dorset House, 1985, 0-932633-01-3
A short Gerry Weinberg book, which I find useful for the
three laws he presents:

> [p5] The First Law of Consulting:
> In spite of what your client may tell you, there's always a problem.

> The Second Law of Consulting:
> No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.

> The Third Law of Consulting:
> Never forget they're paying you by the hour, not by the solution.
