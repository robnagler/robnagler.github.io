America, and the Woman Who Stopped Them"

By Timothy Egan, Viking, April 4, 2023

I finished this book at 4 a.m. That's the endorsement. Read this book
if you think we live in a divisive and violent time. The KKK knew how
to sow real division. In the 1920's, the KKK saw huge growth by
dividing people and constant violence.

At times the book reads like a historical novel. That's why I couldn't
put it down at the end. I had to find out how it happened. I knew the
conclusion from the subtitle, but I wanted to see how the trial played
out.

The heroes: Madge Oberholtzer, Patrick O'Donnell, George Dale, Rabbi
Feuerlicht, William REmy, and many others. I was going to name the
villain, but that just gives fame to the villain.

To me this quote from the book summarizes the real villain:

> A vein of hatred was always there for the tapping. It's there still,
> and explains much of the madness threatening American life a hundred
> years [later]. The Grand Dragon was a symptom, not a cause, of an
> age that has been mischaracterized as one of Gatsby frivolity and
> the mayhem of modernism.

It's a painful read. The subjugation of large parts of our society
through Jim Crow laws, mob violence, and daily shunning is hard to
read for me. I realize that's trite, because people had to live it but
I live in different times. I can't imagine what it was like to live
then even after having read very clearly what it was like.

> [k1130] On Saint Patrick's Day, a crowd filled basketball-rattled

> [k1524] As Stephenson neared the end of that night's speech, he
> summarized what was at stake when "members of inferior races" were let
> into the United States. "This is a struggle to save America," he said.
> "It's a struggle perhaps even more serious than that between the states
> in the Civil War." The hundred percenters from the Heartland were at the
> forefront of a war to prevent "the inevitable destruction of what may be
> called the American race."

> [k1650] Why, Coughlan wondered later as a writer trying to come to grips
> with what had happened to his neighbors, "did the town take so
> whole-heartedly to the Klan?" His answer was rooted in "the deadly tedium
> of small-town life," a militant religious fundamentalism "hot with
> bigotry," and "American moralistic blood lust that is half historical
> determinism, and half Freud."

> [k2188] In cities big and small, North and South, the blazing cross had
> become as much a part of life as the soda fountain and the barbershop
> pole. More than 10,000 turned out for a Klan picnic in Colorado. The Klan
> terrorized Jewish, Italian, Black, and Latino neighborhoods in Denver,
> and could count on brothers under the sheets in law enforcement to avoid
> arrest. "They paid ten dollars to hate someone," said a Denver judge,
> "and they were determined to get their money's worth."

> [k2210] The National Origins Act of 1924, a Klan-blessed master design

> [k2302] He noted that the 18th Amendment, outlawing alcohol, was fully

> not empower a deputy marshal to protect the Negro's ballot," said
> Johnson.

> [k2325] Elsewhere, the Empire elected not just a governor in Colorado,
> Clarence Morley, but a United States senator, Rice Means. In Denver, an
> oath-bound Klansman, Ben Stapleton, survived a recall election in a city
> where one in seven voters had taken the same vows. "I will work with the
> Klan and for the Klan," he pledged afterward. "I shall give the Klan the
> kind of administration it wants."

> [k2333] Forty years of Jim Crow in the South and voter restrictions aimed
> at immigrants in the North were able to shrink the American electorate as

> 1924 presidential election--an all-time low.

> [k2413] Under Prohibition, people with a doctor's note could buy a pint

> [k4043] Across the country, another prominent Klansman was embroiled in a
> sordid tale that defied the hooded order's professed values. Dr. Ellis O.
> Willson, a dentist who'd been a leader of the large Klan chapter in La
> Grande, Oregon, was charged with raping his clerical assistant, and then
> killing her accidentally during a botched abortion.

> [k4049] In Colorado, three Klansmen were charged in separate cases of
> child molestation and statutory rape. The Grand Dragon, Dr. John Galen
> Locke, was implicated in the kidnapping of a nineteen-year-old who had
> refused to marry his pregnant girlfriend--a violation of the Klan's
> professed values of sexual purity and the sanctity of marriage.

> He called it an "unlawful organization, so destructive of the rights and

> [k4203] Those days were gone--a shameful aberration in the American

> paper sketched an outline that sounded like a bad fairy tale. "It came
> about that American citizens in Indiana were judged by their religion,
> condemned because of their race, illegally punished because of their

> [k4258] We should also think about another cause and effect, or lack
> thereof. Stephenson was a charismatic con man--"the most talented
