The Coddling of the American Mind blames safetyism
(safety as a sacred, societal value) as the root cause to many of the
campus protests taht started a few years ago. Students disrupted
campuses quite violently to
stop conserative speakers (mostly) from giving talks on campus.

I agree with the premise of the book. It was my personal experience
that kids were overscheduled and stressed as a result. They didn't
just go out and play, not like when I grew up. As a result, teenage
girls are twice as likely to die by their own hand than they were 20
years ago. Anxiety and depression is quite common among teens.

College students are ill-prepared for being on their own, and facing
challenges to their belief system. Identity politics has permeated
campuses. Kids are to be protected from "triggering events" (like
people who disagree with them).

It's a big problem that leads to crazy stories that conservatives use
to rile their base. Trump recently created the
[1776 Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1776_Commission) to
promote "patriotic education". This is a direct response to all the
BLM and LGBTQ protests going on at the moment.

What to do about all this? Back to basics: less screen time, more free
play (expand recess), fewer rules, debate club, etc. The ideas are
fine, and perhaps we'll see some change. I am doubtful, but I am also
encouraged that this book presents the problems and solutions so
clearly.

> [k263] This is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread
> widely in recent years:
>
> 1. The Untruth of Fragility: __What doesn't kill you makes you weaker__.
> 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: __Always trust your feelings__.
> 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: __Life is a battle between good people and evil people__.
>
> While many propositions are untrue, in order to
> be classified as a Great Untruth, an idea must meet three criteria:
>
> 1. It contradicts ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures).
> 2. It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being.
> 3. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.

> [k297] In years past, administrators were motivated to create campus
> speech codes in order to curtail what they deemed to be racist or sexist
> speech. Increasingly, however, the rationale for speech codes and speaker
> disinvitations was becoming medicalized: Students claimed that certain
> kinds of speech--and even the content of some books and
> courses--interfered with their __ability to function__. They wanted
> protection from material that they believed could jeopardize their mental
> health by "triggering" them, or making them "feel unsafe."

> [k322] What is new today is the premise that students are fragile. Even
> those who are not fragile themselves often believe that others are in
> danger and therefore need protection. There is no expectation that
> students will grow stronger from their encounters with speech or texts
> they label "triggering." (This is the Untruth of Fragility: __What doesn't
> kill you makes you weaker__.)

> [k327] CBT teaches you to notice when you are engaging in various
> "cognitive distortions," such as "catastrophizing" (__If I fail this quiz,
> I'll fail the class and be kicked out of school, and then I'll never get
> a job...__) and "negative filtering" (__only paying attention to negative
> feedback instead of noticing praise as well__).

> [k329] These distorted and irrational thought patterns are hallmarks of
> depression and anxiety disorders. We are not saying that students are
> never in real physical danger, or that their claims about injustice are
> usually cognitive distortions. We are saying that even when students are
> reacting to real problems, they are more likely than previous generations
> to engage in thought patterns that make those problems seem more
> threatening, which makes them harder to solve. An important discovery by
> early CBT researchers was that if people learn to stop thinking this way,
> their depression and anxiety usually subside.


> [k336] College students today are far more diverse. They arrive on campus
> having faced varying degrees of bigotry, poverty, trauma, and mental
> illness. Educators must account for those differences, reevaluate old
> assumptions, and strive to create an inclusive community. But what is the
> best way to do that? If we are especially concerned about the students
> who have faced the most serious obstacles, should our priority be
> protecting them from speakers, books, and ideas that might offend them?

> [k375] At some schools, a culture of defensive self-censorship seemed to
> be emerging, partly in response to students who were quick to "call out"
> or shame others for small things that they deemed to be
> insensitive--either to the student doing the calling out or to members of
> a group that the student was standing up for. We called this pattern
> __vindictive protectiveness__ and argued that such behavior made it more
> difficult for all students to have open discussions in which they could
> practice the essential skills of critical thinking and civil
> disagreement.

> Our article was published on __The Atlantic__'s website on
> August 11, 2015, and the magazine issue that featured it hit newsstands
> about a week later.

> [k429] We adapt to our new and improved circumstances and then lower the
> bar for what we count as intolerable levels of discomfort and risk. By
> the standards of our great-grandparents, nearly all of us are coddled.

> [k433] To repeat, we are __not__ saying that the problems facing students,
> and young people more generally, are minor or "all in their heads." We
> are saying that what people choose to __do__ in their heads will determine
> how those real problems affect them.

> [k436] That means __seeking out challenges__ (rather than eliminating or
> avoiding everything that "feels unsafe"), __freeing yourself from cognitive
> distortions__ (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and
> __taking a generous view of other people__, and __looking for nuance__ (rather
> than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them
> morality).

> [k502] Among the children who had been "protected" from peanuts, 17% had
> developed a peanut allergy. In the group that had been deliberately
> exposed to peanut products, only 3% had developed an allergy.

> [k550] The foolishness of overprotection is apparent as soon as you
> understand the concept of antifragility.

> [k636] One student who sought out the safe space put it this way: "I was
> feeling bombarded by a lot of viewpoints that really go against my dearly
> and closely held beliefs."

> [k645] But young adults are not flickering candle flames. They are
> antifragile, and that is true even of victims of violence and those who
> suffer from PTSD. Research on "post-traumatic growth" shows that __most
> people__ report becoming stronger, or better in some way, after suffering
> through a traumatic experience.

> [k651] Avoiding triggers is a __symptom__ of PTSD, not a treatment for it.

> [k665] Safety is good, of course, and keeping others safe from harm is
> virtuous, but virtues can become vices when carried to extremes.
> "Safetyism" refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has
> become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make
> trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns.

> [k676] She calls those born in and after 1995 "iGen," short for "internet
> Generation." (Others use the term "Generation Z.") Twenge shows that iGen
> suffers from far higher rates of anxiety and depression than did
> Millennials at the same age--and higher rates of suicide.

> [k680] By 2011 or so, most teens could check in on their social media
> status every few minutes, and many did.

> [k691] Rather, we are proposing that today's college students were raised
> by parents and teachers who had children's best interests at heart but
> who often did not give them the freedom to develop their antifragility.

> [k721] We opened this chapter with a quotation from the Greek Stoic
> philosopher Epictetus, but we could just as easily have quoted Buddha
> ("Our life is the creation of our mind") or Shakespeare ("There is
> nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so") or Milton ("The
> mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of
> heaven").

> [k736] Happiness, maturity, and even enlightenment require rejecting the
> Untruth of Emotional Reasoning and learning instead to __question__ our
> feelings.

> [k765] Beck noticed a common pattern of beliefs, which he called the
> "cognitive triad" of depression: "I'm no good," "My world is bleak," and
> "My future is hopeless."
>
> Many people experience one or two of these thoughts fleetingly,
> but depressed people tend to hold all three beliefs in a stable and
> enduring psychological structure. Psychologists call such structures
> __schemas__.

> [k769] Depressed people have schemas about themselves and their paths
> through life that are thoroughly disempowering.
>
> Beck's great discovery was that it is possible to break the
> disempowering feedback cycle between negative beliefs and negative
> emotions. If you can get people to examine these beliefs and consider
> counterevidence, it gives them at least some moments of relief from
> negative emotions, and if you release them from negative emotions, they
> become more open to questioning their negative beliefs. It takes some
> skill to do this--depressed people are very good at finding evidence for
> the beliefs in the triad.

> [k843] Unfortunately, when Sue included "unintentional" slights, and when
> he defined the slights __entirely in terms of the listener's
> interpretation__, he encouraged people to make such misperceptions. He
> encouraged them to engage in emotional reasoning--to start with their
> feelings and then justify those feelings by drawing the conclusion that
> someone has committed an act of __aggression__ against them.

> [k907] However, some activists say that bigotry is only about impact (as
> they define impact); intent is not even necessary.
> If a member of an identity group __feels__ offended or oppressed by
> the action of another person, then according to the impact-versus-intent
> paradigm, that other person is guilty of an act of bigotry.

> [k988] The notion that a university should protect all of its students
> from ideas that some of them find offensive is a repudiation of the
> legacy of Socrates, who described himself as the "gadfly" of the Athenian
> people. He thought it was his job to sting, to disturb, to question, and
> thereby to provoke his fellow Athenians to think through their current
> beliefs, and change the ones they could not defend.

> [k999] The response from Williams students was so ferocious that
> ultimately Wood and Hennessy decided they had to cancel the event. One
> student wrote on a Facebook page:
>
> > When you bring a misogynistic, white
> > supremacist men's rights activist to campus in the name of "dialogue" and
> > "the other side," you are not only causing actual mental, social,
> > psychological, and physical harm to students, but you are

> [k1180] Part of Dr. King's genius was that he appealed to the shared
> morals and identities of Americans by using the unifying languages of
> religion and patriotism.

> [k1182] He spoke often of the need for love and forgiveness, hearkening
> back to the words of Jesus and echoing ancient wisdom from many cultures:
> "Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend"
> and "Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate
> cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."

> [k1397] Conor Friedersdorf, who writes about higher education at __The
> Atlantic__, looked into the matter in response to our original "Coddling"
> article in 2015. Students told him things like this: "Students get worked
> up over the smallest of issues ... which has led to the disintegration
> of school spirit and the fracture of campus."

> [k1406] In this comment, we can begin to see the way that social media

> of call-out culture.

> [k1494] He had been banned from Twitter the summer before when Twitter
> concluded that he had violated its policy regarding "inciting or engaging
> in the targeted abuse or harassment of others." Yiannopoulos was a
> skilled provocateur--a master of the art of triggering outrage and then
> using that outrage to embarrass his opponents and advance his goals.

> [k1536] But it's important to take a close look at the February 1 riots
> at UC Berkeley, because they marked a turning point--an escalation of
> conflicts over campus speakers.

> [k1547] The failure of UC Berkeley to openly discipline __any__ of the
> students who engaged in violence or vandalism during the mayhem--even
> those who publicly admitted participating--and the fact that the police
> arrested just one person that night (for failure to disperse) seems to
> have taught the protesters an important lesson: Violence works.

> [k1586] But if asking for peaceful dialogue is __violent__, then it seems
> that the word "violence" is taking on new meanings for some students.
> This is another example of __concept creep__.

> [k1589] Outside of cultures of safetyism, the word "violence" refers to
> __physical__ violence.

> [k1594] The rationale, as an essay in the Berkeley op-ed series argued,
> is that physically violent actions, if used to shut down speech that is
> deemed hateful, are "not acts of violence" but, rather, "acts of self
> defense."

> [k1604] The Columbia University linguist John McWhorter describes how the
> term "white supremacist" is now used in an "utterly athletic,
> recreational" way, as a "battering ram" to attack anyone who departs from
> the party line. McWhorter himself (who is African American) has been
> called a white supremacist for questioning received wisdom on matters
> related to race. But if some students now think it's OK to punch a
> fascist or white supremacist, and if anyone who disagrees with them can
> be labeled a fascist or white supremacist, well, you can see how this
> rhetorical move might make people hesitant to voice dissenting views on
> campus.

> [k1661] The students continued: "If engaged, Heather Mac Donald would not
> be debating on mere difference of opinion, but the right of Black people
> to exist." This sentence includes __fortune-telling__, as the students
> predict what Mac Donald would say. It also includes a rhetorical flourish
> that became common in 2017: the assertion that a speaker will "deny"
> people from certain identity groups "the right to exist." This thinking
> is a form of __catastrophizing__, in that it inflates the horrors of a
> speaker's words far beyond what the speaker might actually say. The
> students also called Mac Donald "a fascist, a white supremacist, a
> warhawk, a transphobe, a queerphobe, [and] a classist." This is __labeling__
> running wild--a list of serious accusations made without supporting
> evidence.

> [k1675] As we saw in chapter 3, this kind of identity politics amplifies
> the human proclivity for us-versus-them thinking. It prepares students
> for battle, not for learning.

> [k1777] Interpreting a campus lecture as violence is a choice, and it is
> a choice that increases your pain with respect to the lecture while
> reducing your options for how to respond.

> [k1946] She asserted that Tuvel "enacts violence and perpetuates harm in
> numerous ways throughout her essay," because she "deadnames a trans
> woman" (that is, Tuvel mentioned that Jenner's former male, or "dead,"
> name, was Bruce),24 she "uses the term 'transgenderism,'" she "talks
> about 'biological sex,'" and she "uses phrases like 'male genitalia.'" It
> is striking how many of the critics' complaints refer not to Tuvel's
> __arguments__ but to her __word choices__.
> In fact, one of the arguments for retraction given in the open
> letter was that Tuvel used "vocabulary and frameworks not recognized,
> accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields."

> [k2039] Things began to change rapidly, however, in the late 1990s.
> That's when the professors from the Greatest Generation began to retire,
> to be replaced by members of the Baby Boom generation. By 2011, the ratio
> had reached five to one. The Greatest Generation professors were
> predominantly white men who had fought in World War II, and then got a
> boost into higher education from legislation designed to help them in the
> postwar period.

> [k2051] In Jon's field, academic psychology, the left-to-right ratio was
> between two to one and four to one from the 1930s through the mid-1990s,
> but then it began to shoot upward, reaching seventeen to one by 2016.44
> The ratios in other core fields in the humanities and social sciences are
> nearly all above ten to one.

> [k2058] The loss of political diversity among professors, particularly in
> fields that deal with politicized content, can undermine the quality and
> rigor of scholarly research.

> [k2295] But if we step back and look at American universities as complex
> institutions nested within a larger society that has been growing
> steadily more divided, angry, and polarized, we begin to see the left and
> the right locked into a game of mutual provocation and reciprocal outrage
> that is an essential piece of the puzzle we are trying to solve in this
> book.

> [k2306] Things are indeed at a "boiling point" in the United States.

> [k2336] Why is this happening? There are many reasons, but in order to
> make sense of America's current predicament, you have to start by
> recognizing that the mid-twentieth century was a historical anomaly--a
> period of unusually low political polarization and cross-party animosity7
> combined with generally high levels of social trust and trust in
> government.

> [k2342] Given the psychology of tribalism that we described in chapter 3,
> the loss of a common enemy after the collapse of the Soviet Union can be
> expected to lead to more intratribal conflict.
>
> A second major reason is that, since the 1970s, Americans have
> been increasingly self-segregating into politically homogeneous
> communities, as Bill Bishop showed in his influential 2008 book, __The Big
> Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart__.

> [k2351] A third major reason is the media environment, which has changed
> in ways that foster division.

> [k2358] Both the physical and the electronic isolation from people we
> disagree with allow the forces of confirmation bias, groupthink, and
> tribalism to push us still further apart.
>
> A fourth reason is the increasingly bitter hostility in
> Congress. The Democrats controlled the House of Representatives for about
> sixty years, with only brief interruptions in the mid- to late twentieth
> century, but their dominance ended in 1994, when the Republicans swept to
> victory under Newt Gingrich, who became Speaker of the House. Gingrich
> then imposed a set of reforms intended to discourage his many new members
> from forging the sort of personal relationships across party lines that
> had been normal in previous decades.

> [k2379] This is an essential part of our story. Americans now bear such
> animosity toward one another that it's almost as if many are holding up
> signs saying, "Please tell me something horrible about the other side,
> I'll believe anything!" Americans are now easily exploitable, and a large
> network of profit-driven media sites, political entrepreneurs, and
> foreign intelligence agencies are taking advantage of this vulnerability.

> [k2387] But as campus activism increased in 2015 and offered up an
> unending stream of dramatic cell phone videos (including students cursing
> at professors and shouting down speakers), right-wing media outlets began
> to devote far more attention to campus events, which they portrayed
> gleefully, usually stripped of any explanatory context.

> [k2569] The second of our six explanatory threads is the rise in rates of
> depression and anxiety among American adolescents in the 2010s.
> These mood disorders have many close relationships with the
> three Great Untruths.

> [k2644] In short, iGen is the first generation that spent (and is now
> spending) its formative teen years immersed in the giant social and
> commercial experiment of social media.

> [k2654] The first is that kids now grow up much more slowly. Activities
> that are commonly thought to mark the transition from childhood to
> adulthood are happening later--for example, having a job, driving a car,
> drinking alcohol, going out on a date, and having sex. Members of iGen
> wait longer to do these things-- and then do less of them--than did
> members of previous generations.

> [k2661] As Twenge puts it, "-year-olds now act like 15-year-olds used to,
> and 13-year-olds like 10-year-olds. Teens are physically safer than ever,
> yet they are more mentally vulnerable."

> [k2666] The second major generational change is a rapid rise in rates of
> anxiety and depression.

> [k2702] Compared to the early 2000s, __nearly twice as many teenage girls
> now end their own lives__. In Canada, too, the suicide rate for teen girls
> is rising, though not as sharply, while the rate for teen boys has
> fallen. (In the United Kingdom, there is no apparent trend for either
> gender in recent years.)

> [k2767] And as Twenge reports, "Girls use social media more often, giving
> them additional opportunities to feel excluded and lonely when they see
> their friends or classmates getting together without them."

> [k2770] From 2010 to 2015, the percentage of teen boys who said they
> often felt left out increased from 21 to 27. For girls, the percentage
> jumped from 27 to 40.

> [k2782] When you add it all up, there's no overall sex difference in
> total aggression, but there's a large and consistent sex difference in
> the preferred __ways__ of harming others.

> [k2784] Plus, if boys' aggression is generally delivered in person, then
> the targets of boys' aggression can escape from it when they go home. On
> social media, girls can never escape.
> On social media, girls can never escape.

> [k2843] Furthermore, when people are depressed, or when their anxiety
> sets their threat-response system on high alert, they can succumb to a
> "hostile attribution bias," which means that they are more likely to see
> hostility in benign or even benevolent people, communications, and
> situations.

> [k2902] Soon, Skenazy was decried as "America's Worst Mom."
>
> Most mothers
> would probably be mortified by that nickname, but Skenazy embraced the
> title. She had given her son the kind of independence that she (and most
> of today's parents) had enjoyed back in the 1970s, when the crime rate
> was much higher.

> [k2906] She called it __Free-Range Kids__. Since then, __Free-Range Kids__

> grown into a full-fledged movement, including a book of the same name,

> [k2917] We suggest that modern parenting practices may unwittingly teach
> children the Great Untruths, and we examine how parents and elementary
> schools may unknowingly work together to induct children into the culture
> of safetyism.

> [k2939] Adam's father, John Walsh, has devoted his life to trying to save
> other children from suffering a similar fate. He created the Adam Walsh
> Child Resource Center, which advocated for legislative reform and
> succeeded in prodding the U.S. government to create the National Center
> for Missing & Exploited Children in 1984. He worked with producers to
> create the made-for-TV movie __Adam__, which was seen by 38 million viewers
> when it first aired. In 1988, Walsh launched a true-crime TV show,
> __America's Most Wanted__, which presented cases of unsolved crimes,
> including child abductions, and asked the public for help. Walsh was
> instrumental in a novel method of disseminating photographs of missing
> children: printing them on milk cartons, under the big all-caps word
> MISSING.

> [k2948] The abduction and murder of a child by a stranger is among the
> most horrific crimes one can imagine. It is also, thankfully, among the
> rarest.

> [k2953] the number abducted by a stranger is a tiny fraction of 1% of
> children reported missing--roughly one hundred children per year in a
> nation with more than 70 million minors.
> And since the 1990s, the rates of all crimes against children
> have gone down, while the chances of a kidnapped child surviving the
> ordeal have gone up.

> [k2966] In 2013, for example, the murder rate dropped to the same level
> it had been at __sixty years earlier__.

> [k2968] American parenting is now wildly out of sync with the actual
> risk that strangers pose to children.

> [k2975] Lythcott-Haims and Skenazy both shared stories with us about

> [k2979] While referencing her own nine-year-old son, the psychologist

>
> * Never send a child into a public restroom alone.
> * Instruct your child to use a private bathroom stall rather than a urinal.
> * Avoid restrooms with more than one entrance.
> * Stand in the door and talk to your child throughout their time in the bathroom.

> [k2996] Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48%
> reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids
> between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of
> younger kids (ages one to four).

> [k3000] A problem with this kind of thinking is that when we attempt to
> produce perfectly safe systems, we almost inevitably create new and
> unforeseen problems.

> [k3031] In fact, even though mothers today have fewer children and spend

> [k3264] In contrast to the decreased time spent in play between 1981 and

> [k3845] At young ages, kids have trouble following this intuition when

> Developmental psychologists Christina Starmans, Mark Sheskin,
> and Paul Bloom reviewed the research on fairness in children and
> concluded that "humans naturally favour fair distributions, not equal
> ones," and "when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair
> inequality over unfair equality."

> [k3852] And sometimes distributive justice calls for inequality; for
> example, when attending to need, particularly within a family or group
> that has some communal feeling and that thinks it fair and proper to
> route resources to whoever needs them most.

> [k3855] Proportionality is the heart of "equity theory," the major
> theory of distributive justice in social psychology.

> [k3870] An early study testing equity theory found that when people were

> [k3874] The social psychologist Tom
> Tyler is one of the pioneers of research on "procedural
> justice." His central finding is that people are much more willing to
> accept a decision or action, even one that goes against themselves, when
> they perceive that the process that led to the decision was fair.

> [k3891] If you want to motivate people to support a new policy or join a
> movement in the name of justice, you need to activate in them a clear
> perception, or intuition, that someone didn't get what he or she deserved
> (distributive injustice) or that someone was a victim of an unfair
> process (procedural injustice).

> [k3907] Using that definition of social justice, we'll define
> __proportional-procedural social justice as the effort to find and fix
> cases where distributive or procedural justice is denied to people
> because they were born into poverty or belong to a socially disadvantaged
> category__.

> [k3912] The civil rights campaign was a long struggle for
> proportional-procedural social justice.

> [k3932] She pointed out that seemingly fair processes can sometimes lead

> [k4121] The suggestions we make here are tailored for American parents
> who use the "concerted cultivation" style of parenting that we described

> [k4124] This time-intensive, labor-intensive strategy involves
> overprotecting, overscheduling, and overparenting children in hopes of
> giving them an edge in a competitive society that has forgotten the
> importance of play and the value of unsupervised experience.

> [k4130] Just as we were finishing this book, the head teacher of an
> elementary school in East London issued a rule that children must not
> even __touch__ recently fallen snow, because touching could lead to
> __snowballs__.

> [k4133] That is the epitome of safetyism: If we can prevent __one__ child
> from getting hurt, we should deprive __all__ children of slightly risky play.

> [k4141] The first of the three epigraphs that we used at the beginning of
> this book summarizes the book's most important single piece of advice:
> __Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child__.

> [k4146] You cannot teach antifragility directly, but you can give your
> children the gift of experience--the thousands of experiences they need
> to become resilient, autonomous adults.

> [k4152] __Assume that your kids are more capable this month than they were
> last month__.

> [k4156] __Let your kids take more small risks__, and let them learn from
> getting some bumps and bruises.

> [k4162] __Learn about Lenore Skenazy's Free-Range Kids movement, and
> incorporate her lessons into your family's life__.

> [k4184] __Encourage your children to walk or ride bicycles to and from
> school__ at the earliest ages possible, consistent with local circumstances
> of distance, traffic, and crime.

> [k4187] __Help your kids find a community of kids in the neighborhood__ who
> come from families that share your commitment to avoid overprotection.

> [k4191] __Send your children to an overnight summer camp in the woods__ for a
> few weeks--without devices.

> [k4197] __Encourage your children to engage in a lot of "productive
> disagreement."__

> [k4210] The second epigraph at the start of this book came from Buddha:
> "Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts,
> unguarded.
> But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your
> father or your mother."

> [k4212] __Teach children the basics of CBT.__

> [k4232] __Teach children mindfulness.__

> [k4243] The third epigraph at the start of this book came from __The Gulag
> Archipelago__, the memoir of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Russian dissident of
> the Soviet era.

> [k4250] He then warns his readers to beware of the Untruth of Us Versus Them:
>
> > If only it were so simple! If only there were evil people
> > somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only
> > to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line
> > dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.


> [k4255] __Give people the benefit of the doubt.__

> [k4259] __Practice the virtue of "intellectual humility."__

> [k4263] Until that moment, the feeling of being __wrong__ is
> indistinguishable from the feeling of being __right__. We are all wrong about
> many things at every moment, but until we know it, we are often quite
> certain that we are right.
> Having people around us who are willing to disagree with us is
> a gift.

> [k4267] __Look very carefully at how your school handles identity politics.__

> [k4275] Efforts made by parents have a greater chance of success if
> schools share parents' concerns about defeating the Great Untruths, and
> these efforts will be undercut if schools adhere to the Great Untruths.

> [k4278] __Homework in the early grades should be minimal.__

> [k4286] __Give more recess with less supervision.__

> [k4295] (In fact, the principal of the New Zealand school reports that
> bullying has gone __down__ since instituting no-rules recess.)

> [k4299] __Discourage the use of the word "safe" or "safety" for anything
> other than physical safety.__

> [k4308] __Have a "no devices" policy.__

> [k4312] __Protect or expand middle school recess.__

> [k4316] __Cultivate the intellectual virtues.__ The intellectual virtues are
> the qualities necessary to be a critical thinker and an effective
> learner. They include curiosity, open-mindedness, and intellectual
> humility.

> [k4326] __Teach debate and offer debate club.__

> [k4333] __Assign readings and coursework that promote reasoned discussion.__

> [k4346] Left to their own devices, as it were, many children would spend
> most of their free time staring into a screen.

> [k4370] Electronic device use should be discontinued thirty to sixty
> minutes before bedtime, at which point all devices should be placed in a
> box or drawer in the kitchen (or somewhere away from the child's
> bedroom).

> [k4379] We propose that Americans consider adopting a new national norm:
> taking a year off after high school--a "gap year"--as Malia Obama did in
> 2016. It's an idea that has been gaining support among high school
> counselors, experts in adolescent development, and college admissions
> officers.

> [k4384] Retired General Stanley McChrystal is the chair of Service Year
> Alliance, an organization that supports recent high school or college
> graduates in finding full-time, paid opportunities to spend a year
> working on projects to benefit American communities.

> [k4469] The more reactive universities are to public outrage or illiberal
> demands for censorship and punishment, the more outrage and illiberal
> demands they will receive.

> [k4603] Pinker and Ridley both base their optimism in part on a simple
> observation: The more serious a problem gets, the more inducements there
> are for people, companies, and governments to find innovative solutions,
> whether driven by personal commitment, market forces, or political
> pressures.

> [k4624] In March 2018, Utah became the first state to pass into law a
> "free-range parenting" bill--and with unanimous bipartisan support.

> [k4631] It has become increasingly clear that identitarian extremists on
> both sides rely on the most outrageous acts of the other side to unite
> their group around its common enemy.

> [k4657] __Universities committing to truth as a process.__ The University of
> Chicago has long been an outlier in the intensity of its academic
> culture. (It proudly embraces the unofficial motto "Where fun goes to
> die.")

> [k4661] Many universities are adopting the Chicago Statement and are
v> beginning to push back against the creep of safetyism.
